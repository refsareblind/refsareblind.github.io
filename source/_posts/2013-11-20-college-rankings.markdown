## The Rules
  1. Must be on an NBA team for the 2013-2014 NBA Season
  2. Injured counts
  3. A college must be able to field a team of five players to qualify
  4. The rankings are based on who would win if the teams went head to head in a twenty minute game with no subs
  5. Bench depth wasn't counted, only the strength of the best five-person lineup
  6. Stats are at date 11.20.2013

## The Rankings

### #20 - Gonzaga
``` plain The Roster
(LAL) Elias Harris
(TOR) Austin Daye
(BOS) Kelly Olynyk
(LAL) Robert Sacre
(MIN) Ronny Turiaf
```

``` plain The Stats
Minutes  47.1 [ 20th ]
Points   11.4 [ 20th ]
Assists  4.2  [ 18th ]
Rebounds 10.8 [ 19th ]
Steals   1.6  [ 19th ]
Blocks   1.5  [ 18th ]
```

Congratulations to the Zags for even being able to field a team for this tournament. They're the only mid-major school that is able to put a 5-man rotation together and book their ticket, but unfortunately that's where the good news ends for this Zags squad. With no guards on their roster 6'8 forward and role player for the Lakers - Elias Harris - is forced to play the point. 6'11 Austin Daye is forced to play the 2 meaning the Zags field a backcourt that's averaging less than a point per game. Boston rookie Kelly Olynyk is the teams go to scoring option at the 3 - and when your teams leading scorer averages 8 points per game, you're in a lot of trouble. This team is dead on arrival.

### #19 - Louisville
``` plain The Roster
(DET) Peyton Siva
(NYK) Chris Smith
(HOU) Francisco Garcia
(CLE) Earl Clark
(MIN) Gorgui Dieng
```

``` plain The Stats
Minutes  50.1 [ 19th ]
Points   14.2 [ 19th ]
Assists  1.8  [ 20th ]
Rebounds 8.0  [ 20th ]
Steals   1.6  [ 20th ]
Blocks   1.7  [ 17th ]
```

Louisville is able to put a team together that is positionally sound, but the lack of talent is too big a hurdle to overcome. Combined they're only putting up 13 points per game and the backcourt of Siva-Smith is overmatched by every team sans the Harris-Daye duo of the Zags. Garcia and Clark have to carry the scoring for a team that will struggle mightily on offense.

### #18 - LSU
``` plain The Roster
(WAS) Garrett Temple
(SAC) Marcus Thornton
(BOS) Brandon Bass
(DEN) Anthony Randolph
(ORL) Glen Davis
```

``` plain The Stats
Minutes  81.8 [ 18th ]
Points   29.0 [ 18th ]
Assists  4.0  [ 19th ]
Rebounds 12.8 [ 18th ]
Steals   2.5  [ 17th ]
Blocks   1.8  [ 16th ]
```

LSU suffers from the same "lack of talent" problem that plagues Louisville.

### #17 - Georgetown
``` plain The Roster
(WAS) Otto Porter
(BOS) Jeff Green
(PHI) Hollis Thompson
(DET) Greg Monroe
(IND) Roy Hibbert
```

``` plain The Stats
Minutes  109.5 [ 16th ]
Points   45.0  [ 15th ]
Assists  4.9   [ 17th ]
Rebounds 24.5  [ 9th ]
Steals   2.1   [ 18th ]
Blocks   6.0   [ 2nd ]
```

Much like Gonzaga the Hoyas are crippled by a lack of options in the backcourt and have to put Boston forwrd Jeff Green at the 2 and rely on the currently injured Washington rookie and pending bust Otto Porter to run the point in his first NBA action. Even though the Hoyas are defensively sound and have a menacing front court in Monroe and Hibbert, this team gets smoked by every team ahead of them. You're only a couple pieces away from being a contender Georgetown.

### #16 - Washington
``` plain The Roster
(DEN) Nate Robinson
(SAC) Isaiah Thomas
(PHI) Tony Wroten
(MEM) Quincy Pondexter
(PHI) Spencer Hawes
```

``` plain The Stats
Minutes  120.1 [ 14th ]
Points   58.3  [ 12th ]
Assists  14.6  [ 7th ]
Rebounds 20.1  [ 13th ]
Steals   3.6   [ 15th ]
Blocks   2.2   [ 14th ]
```

Washington runs a pretty balanced attack. Had Washington been able to steal Washington State alum Klay Thompson onto this team they might be able to contend, but as it stands there's not enough talent to go any further.

### #15 - Arizona
``` plain The Roster
(MEM) Jerryd Bayless
(BRK) Jason Terry
(GSW) Andre Iguodala
(PHO) Channing Frye
(LAL) Jordan Hill
```

``` plain The Stats
Minutes  120.3 [ 13th ]
Points   44.3  [ 17th ]
Assists  10.4  [ 11th ]
Rebounds 22.1  [ 11th ]
Steals   4.0   [ 13th ]
Blocks   2.3   [ 12th ]
```

Boring washed up team. They can play defense and shoot, but that's pretty much it.

### #14 - Kansas
``` plain The Roster
(MIA) Mario Chalmers
(SAC) Ben McLemore
(LAL) Xavier Henry
(BRK) Paul Pierce
(OKC) Nick Collison
```

``` plain The Stats
Minutes  118.8 [ 15th ]
Points   44.9  [ 16th ]
Assists  10.2  [ 12th ]
Rebounds 17.4  [ 17th ]
Steals   4.9   [ 10th ]
Blocks   0.8   [ 19th ]
```

In a controversial decision Kansas elects to go with Ben McLemore and Xavier Henry over Phoenix forward Markieff Morris. With a washed up Paul Pierce the scoring just isn't there to push the team forward.


### #13 - Marquette
``` plain The Roster
(MIA) Dwyane Wade
(POR) Wesley Matthews
(CHI) Jimmy Butler
(DAL) Jae Crowder
(TOR) Steve Novak
```

``` plain The Stats
Minutes  128.4 [ 12th ]
Points   51.8  [ 14th ]
Assists  9.6   [ 15th ]
Rebounds 19.2  [ 15th ]
Steals   6.1   [ 5th ]
Blocks   2.3   [ 11th ]
```

Marquette is tough, but suffers from a poor frontcourt. Steve Novak is the only 6'8 player on the roster and is forced to slide into the center position where he gets abused defensively. The Dwyane Wade point guard experiment goes worse than expected.

### #12 - Ohio State
``` plain The Roster
(MEM) Mike Conley
(PHI) Evan Turner
(BOS) Jared Sullinger
(MEM) Kosta Koufos
(MIA) Greg Oden
```

``` plain The Stats
Minutes  106.1 [ 17th ]
Points   58.4  [ 11th ]
Assists  11.3  [ 9th ]
Rebounds 18.1  [ 16th ]
Steals   3.0   [ 16th ]
Blocks   1.9   [ 15th ]
```

The only Big Ten team in the tournament.

### #11 - Syracuse
``` plain The Roster
(CLE) Dion Waiters
(PHI) Michael Carter-Williams
(LAL) Wesley Johnson
(NYK) Carmelo Anthony
(NOP) Arinze Onuaku
```

``` plain The Stats
Minutes  136.3 [ 10th ]
Points   65.2  [ 8th ]
Assists  15.0  [ 5th ]
Rebounds 23.4  [ 10th ]
Steals   6.7   [ 3rd ]
Blocks   3.3   [ 5th ]
```

In another universe this Syracuse team might be able to put up a fight, but when you look past it for a minute you can see the gaping holes emerge. A solid 1-2 scoring combo of MCW and Carmelo Anthony is bookended by super busts Dion Waiters and Wesley Johnson. With Melo carrying the offense Pelicans rookie Arinze Onuaku is in charge of the interior defense. Melo's scoring isn't enough to take the Orange very far.

### #10 - USC
``` plain The Roster
(MIL) O.J. Mayo
(TOR) DeMar DeRozan
(LAL) Nick Young
(CHI) Taj Gibson
(ORL) Nikola Vucevic
```

``` plain The Stats
Minutes  154.3 [ 5th ]
Points   77.4  [ 6th ]
Assists  10.0  [ 13th ]
Rebounds 27.0  [ 8th ]
Steals   4.8   [ 11th ]
Blocks   3.0   [ 7th ]
```

### #9 - North Carolina
``` plain The Roster
(NYK) Raymond Felton

(SAS) Danny Green
(GSW) Harrison Barnes
(TOR) Tyler Hansbrough
```

```
Minutes  139.3 [ 9th ]
Points   59.7  [ 10th ]
Assists  16.5  [ 4th ]
Rebounds 19.6  [ 14th ]
Steals   4.6   [ 12th ]
Blocks   2.7   [ 9th ]
```

### #8 - Connecticut
``` plain The Roster
(OKC) Jeremy Lamb
(MIA) Ray Allen
(MIL) Caron Butler
(TOR) Rudy Gay
(DET) Andre Drummond
```

``` plain The Stats
Minutes  148.7 [ 8th ]
Points   66.3  [ 7th ]
Assists  7.4   [ 16th ]
Rebounds 30.9  [ 5th ]
Steals   6.2   [ 4th ]
Blocks   2.9   [ 8th ]
```

UCONN elects to go with Ray Allen over Kemba Walker at the 2. Really balanced team with good inside scoring.

### #7 - Georgia Tech
``` plain The Roster
(CLE) Jarrett Jack
(NYK) Iman Shumpert
(PHI) Thaddeus Young
(MIA) Chris Bosh
(UTA) Derrick Favors
```

``` plain The Stats
Minutes  152.0 [ 6th ]
Points   62.5  [ 9th ]
Assists  10.5  [ 10th ]
Rebounds 30.2  [ 6th ]
Steals   5.9   [ 6th ]
Blocks   4.4   [ 3rd ]
```

### #6 - Florida
``` plain The Roster
(WAS) Bradley Beal
(HOU) Chandler Parsons
(GSW) David Lee
(ATL) Al Horford
(CHI) Joakim Noah
```

``` plain The Stats
Minutes  169.5 [ 2nd ]
Points   81.4  [ 4th ]
Assists  14.7  [ 6th ]
Rebounds 35.0  [ 1st ]
Steals   5.4   [ 8th ]
Blocks   4.1   [ 4th ]
```

Lack of backcourt options, but incredible interior scoring.

### #5 - Texas
``` plain The Roster
(TOR) D.J. Augustin
(BOS) Avery Bradley
(CLE) Tristan Thompson
(OKC) Kevin Durant
(POR) LaMarcus Aldridge
```

``` plain The Stats
Minutes  151.4 [ 7th ]
Points   80.7  [ 5th ]
Assists  10.0  [ 14th ]
Rebounds 30.1  [ 7th ]
Steals   5.0   [ 9th ]
Blocks   2.2   [ 13th ]
```

Durant is the best player in the tournament. Not enough to carry the team.

### #4 - Duke
``` plain The Roster
(CLE) Kyrie Irving
(LAC) J.J. Redick
(CHI) Luol Deng
(CHI) Carlos Boozer
(PHO) Miles Plumlee
```

Duke opts to start J.J. Redick over Gerald Henderson at the 2 in order to balance the court.

``` plain The Stats
Minutes  163.2  [ 4th ]
Points   81.9   [ 3rd ]
Assists  13.4   [ 8th ]
Rebounds 30.9   [ 4th ]

```

### #3 - Wake Forest
``` plain The Roster
(LAC) Chris Paul
(ATL) Jeff Teague
(PHO) Ishmael Smith
(NOP) Al-Farouq Aminu
(SAS) Tim Duncan
```

``` plain The Stats
Minutes  130.6  [ 11th ]
Points   58.3   [ 13th ]
Assists  28.8   [ 1st ]
Rebounds 21.3   [ 12th ]
Steals   5.5    [ 7th ]
Blocks   2.4    [ 10th ]
```

Love this roster. Love to see the Chris Paul - Tim Duncan combo.

### #2 - Kentucky
``` plain The Roster
(WAS) John Wall
(PHO) Eric Bledsoe
(CHA) Michael Kidd-Gilchrist
(SAC) DeMarcus Cousins
(NOP) Anthony Davis
```

``` plain The Stats
Minutes  166.1 [ 3rd ]
Points   89.9  [ 2nd ]
Assists  20.5  [ 3rd ]
Rebounds 31.6  [ 3rd ]
Steals   8.3   [ 1st ]
Blocks   7.4   [ 1st ]
```

It's loaded. How are they not number 1? Anthony Davis... Boogie Cousins, John Wall. Wall isn't that great...

### #1 - UCLA
``` plain The Roster
(OKC) Russell Westbrook
(NOP) Jrue Holiday
(ORL) Arron Afflalo
(WAS) Trevor Ariza
(MIN) Kevin Love
```

``` plain The Stats
Minutes  173.8 [ 1st ]
Points   99.7  [ 1st ]

Rebounds 33.7  [ 2nd ]
Steals   6.8   [ 2nd ]
Blocks   0.7   [ 20th ]
```

Unstoppable. Boogie Cousins vs. Ariza advantage, but this is a team with 5 players that all shoot 30% from 3PT range, can play up tempo or slow and controlled. Congratulations to UCLA for winning this completely imaginary tournament.
