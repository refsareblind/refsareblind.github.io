# The Rules

  2. Injured counts
  3. A college must be able to field a team of five players to qualify
  4. The rankings are based on who would win if the teams went head to head in a twenty minute game with no subs
  5. Bench depth wasn't counted, only the strength of the best five-person lineup
  6. Stats are at date 11.20.2013
